# Parsing

Scripts used to parse data for my work at Terbine. Generally the data I collect needs to be parsed by year as seen in the ASWS notebook. Sometimes columns also need to be parsed out, as seen in the MODIS notebook and the Parse_States python file. The geolocation file does a reverse lookup of Lat/Long coordinates from the dataframe and appends a new column containing the state that each coordinates falls within. The Galapagos_Tortoise file parses based on year and species of tortoise.
